<p align="center">Replaces the death sound with the one from Ultrakill.</p>

I cut down the sound to 20 seconds just like the original sound is.

It was quieter after the first voice, so I turned up the volume after the first voice so it would stay normal.

Sound taken from: https://youtu.be/LrJ_AXGz68s.

Idea from: CyanPickle.
